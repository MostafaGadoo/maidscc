Introduction
The Library Management System provides an efficient way to manage the inventory of books, keep track of patrons, and handle book borrowing transactions. It offers a set of RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the system, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on books and patrons, as well as borrow books.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
Maven
PostgreSQL (or another supported database)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/library-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd library-management-system
Update the application.properties file in src/main/resources with your database configuration:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/library_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Ensure the database library_db is created in your PostgreSQL instance.

Build the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean package
Running the Application
Run the application using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start at http://localhost:8080.

API Endpoints
Books
GET /api/books: Retrieve a list of all books.
GET /api/books/{id}: Retrieve details of a specific book by ID.
POST /api/books: Add a new book to the library.
PUT /api/books/{id}: Update an existing book's information.

Borrowing

Authentication (if implemented)
If authentication is implemented, you need to obtain an access token before accessing the protected endpoints. Follow the authentication flow as documented below:

Obtain Access Token: Send a POST request to the /authenticate endpoint with valid credentials to obtain an access token.

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -d "username=user&password=pass" http://localhost:8080/authenticate
Use Access Token: Include the access token in the Authorization header for subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" http://localhost:8080/api/protected-endpoint
Sample Requests
Here are some sample requests to interact with the API endpoints:

Retrieve all books:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books
Add a new book:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Book Title","author":"Author Name","publicationYear":2022,"isbn":"9781234567890"}' http://localhost:8080/api/books
Testing
To run unit tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
